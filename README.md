# darkmodewordpressplugin
Simple Dark Mode for WordPress. Lightweight, zero‑config toggle that adds a theme-dark class to &lt;body> and stores preference in localStorage. Theme‑agnostic, works with any block theme. Includes a “Dark Mode Toggle” block and shortcode. Style via CSS variables under .theme-dark. Fast, dependency‑free, and preserves choice across pages.
